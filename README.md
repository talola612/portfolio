## Criterion Collection

* Link to project: [Criterion Collection](#criterion)

### Introduction
As a somewhat cinephile, I am a subscriber to the Criterion Collectoin streaming service, and I get to see some of the best movies ever made on it. But Criterion Collection does more cool things than that - they also focused on distributing "important classic and contemporary films". The company covered things such as film restoration, publishing collectable blue-ray/DVD edition, criticsâ€™ commentary add-ons, and so on and so forth. For this project, I want to investigate on what basis the CC team decides on which film is worth collecting, meaning that I will be looking into the data of all the films they have licensed so far and see what these films align with or diverge from one another, just so we could get a better sense of why the team selected those films and the relationship between different variables (could be country, director, length, format, and etc.).

### Data Source
All data used in this project was obtained from scrapping the list of films on Criterion Collection website. Find [here](https://www.criterion.com/shop/browse/list) for the full list. A scraping notebook could be found on [this github link](https://github.com/talola612/data-studio-projects/blob/master/Criterion%20Channel/Criterion%20Scraping%20.ipynb)
