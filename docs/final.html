That number is approximately equal to <strong>1%</strong> of the U.S. labor force. Perhaps the H-1B visa does not matter much to 99% people in the labor force, but to the other 1% who need some kind of work visa as work authorization, <strong>H-1B</strong> visa is the most popular path to do so, accounting for more than <strong>32%</strong> of total work visa issued in the United States.</p> </div> <div class="step"> <img src="cap.91580541.jpg" style="width:600px;margin:0 auto;"> <p style="max-width:600px;margin:0 auto;font-size:16px;text-align:justify;">But getting a work visa in the first place is never easy. Since the H-1B was created in 1990s, Congress has limited the number of H-1Bs made available each year. As of now, the current annual numerical limit "cap" is 65,000 visas, with an addition of 20,000 H-1B visas for foreign professionals who graduate with a master’s degree or doctorate from a U.S. institution of higher learning.</p> </div> <div class="step"> <img src="app.a74f7713.png" class="app"> <div class="tb" style="text-align:right;font-size:14px;"> <p>But over the years, USCIS has received more petitions than there are visa numbers available as there are always a greater number of skilled workers applying for the H-1B visas.</p> <p>So what happen when the number of applications exceeds the yearly quota? USCIS would conduct a lottery to determine which employers’ petitions for H-1B workers will be processed. Yes, pure luck. </p> <p>However, even if the applicant get drawn, it does not guarantee for approval by the USCIS. There is a chance that the USCIS will issue A Request For Evidence (RFE) to the applicants to provie additional supporting materials for their applications, and in the worst case, a rejection would be issued. </p> <p>Okay, but let's not forget, to qualify for the H-1B application, first the worker needs an employer sponsorship, which is not easy to get for some young professions or people working in certain industries. </p> </div> </div> </div>

The graph on the left show the total number of initial approvals andd the total number of initial denails for first-time H-1B applicants from the year of 2010 to 2019.</p> </div> <div class="step" id="show"> <p style="font-size:13px;">Once approved, the H-1B visa holder is valid to work for up to three years, and they could renew for an additional three years. USCIS also requires H-1B holders to report and update their H-1B visa if they switch company. There is no need to draw a lottery in the above scenarios, but the USCIS reserve the rights to decide that the H-1B holder is not longer eligible and withdraw their work statuss. </p> <p style="font-size:13px;">The total number of approvals/denails include those who are first-time applicants and those who has filed H-1B petition for 2 or more times.</p> </div> <div class="step" id="show-rect"> <p>The grey area highlights the period of <span style="background-color:#d3d3d3;padding-left:3px;padding-right:3px">Trump's administration</span>.</p> <p>As the line chart outlines, the number of total approvals for H-1B is in decline during Trump's administration, while the number of total denials rises. </p> <p>On April 18, 2017, Pressidednt Trump signed the Buy American and Hire American Executive Order, which, just by the title itself, appears to be an anti H-1B act.</p> </div> <div class="step"> <p>The number of total approval under <span style="background-color:#d3d3d3;padding-left:3px;padding-right:3px">Trump's addministration</span> drop much more drastically than the number of initial approval, suggesting that USCIS has implemented a much more rigorous check on the H-1B visa holders to eliminiate fraud and abuse.</p> </div> <div class="step" id="obama"> <p>But what is interesting is that, the most striking drop in H-1B approvals took place in 2015, before <span style="background-color:#d3d3d3;padding-left:3px;padding-right:3px">Trump</span> took office from <font color="orange">Obama</font>.
