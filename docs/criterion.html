If you are a cinephile, you might already know the answer.</p> <p>If you have never heard of it, here is some short overview of this amazing thing: Criterion Collection is a distribution company that focuses on distributing "important classic and contemporary films". The company covers missions such as film restoration, publishing collectable blue-ray/DVD edition, critics’ commentary add-ons, and so on and so forth.  <br><br> <div id="scatterplot-01"> </div> </p><p>From Italian Neorealism to French New Wave, from German Expressionism to Soviet montage, Criterion Collection has them all! It has recently released its epic "Godzilla" Collection for spine #1000, featuring Ishirō Honda’s 1954 original “Godzilla”, “King Kong vs. Godzilla” (1963), “Mothra vs. Godzilla” (1964), and more. </p> <p>Wait, what is a spine number? Someone might ask. The spine number is simply the number that marks the sorted order of entry into the collection, something that helps the collector to keep track of their film collection. </p> </div>

<script src="criterion_scatter.578a6220.js"></script> <div class="story-body"> <div class="col-12"> <h3>WHEN?</h3> <p>If you love films from the 60s, you are in luck! Criterion Collection got your back.</p> <br><br> <div id="linechart-01"> </div> <p>Criterion Collection has liscensed more than 270 films that were made in the 1960s, with a peak at the year of 1966, as a total of 33 films from 1966 are now avaliable on the site for the public to purchase.</p> <p>This also brings us to these following questions: why the 60s? Did more films get produced during that period of time in comparison to other moments in the film history? Or it was because the films made in the 60s had higher quality than the others? Or it was simply CC's preferance on films?</p> <p>Either way, the timeline somewhat reflects the rise and the decline of global art cinema.</p> </div>
