(Continued)</h1> <h2 class="subhead">A closer look into the film liscense pattern of Criterion Collection</h2> <p class="byline"> <a href="https://talola612.github.io/portfolio/">Huiyi Liu</a> </p> <p class="date">Published July 12, 2019</p> </div> <main id="content">   <div class="story-body"> <div class="col-12"> <h3>WHERE?</h3> <p>Let's take a look at the origin of CC's liscensed films. Which continent has more films on the list? Which country has more director on the list?</p> <br> <div id="barchart-01"> </div> <p>Criterion Collection has liscensed more than 270 films that were made in the 1960s, with a peak at the year of 1966, as a total of 33 films from 1966 are now avaliable on the site for the public to purchase.</p> <p>This also brings us to these following questions: why the 60s? Did more films get produced during that period of time in comparison to other moments in the film history? Or it was because the films made in the 60s had higher quality than the others? Or it was simply CC's preferance on films?</p> <p>Either way, the timeline somewhat reflects the rise and the decline of global art cinema.</p> </div>

Among them, films produced in the U.S. take up the majority. The U.S. also has the highest number of directors whose films are liscensed by CC.</p> <p>The graph on the left shows the number of films grouped by country, and the one on the right shows the number of directors by country. These two graphs havev very similar pattern. United States is listed as number 1 on both charts. But the below graph says otherwise - if group all the CC liscensed films by individual director and count the number films for each, none of the top directors are from the U.S. </p> </div>
